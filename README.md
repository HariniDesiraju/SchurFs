# SchurFs

This is a Mathematica package computing Schur functions.
This package, which accompanies a paper [arXiv:1702.07263](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07263), is designed to be applied to computation of (refined/unrefined) Topological vertex: [arXiv:hep-th/0701156](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0701156). 

Author: Kantaro Ohmori. As of Feb. 2017, he is affiliated by Institute for Advanced Study (at Princeton).

This repository composed of three packages:
* YDtips: Just a supplemental package which handles operations on Partitions.
* LRCoeffCoproduct: Calculates Littlewood-Richardson coefficient in a suitable way to generate the coproduct of a Schur function.
* SchurFunction: Main package.
